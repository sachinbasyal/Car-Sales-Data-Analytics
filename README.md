## Background (scenario):
Our organization operates as a car dealership offering a wide range of car models. To optimize performance monitoring and decision-making, we require a robust Car Sales Dashboard built in Power BI. This tool will enable us to track, analyze, and visualize sales data effectively, ensuring we stay competitive and agile in the market.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to design and implement a dynamic, interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will serve as a central platform to visualize and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) critical to our sales operations. It will provide actionable insights into our sales performance over time, enabling data-driven strategies and decisions.

## Problem Statement:
To address the need for better sales monitoring, the dashboard must deliver real-time insights into essential KPIs derived from our sales data. These insights will empower us to:
- Evaluate sales performance and progress against targets.
- Identify emerging trends and areas for growth.
- Make informed decisions to enhance operational efficiency and profitability
By focusing on these requirements, the dashboard will become a vital tool in driving business success.

(2) Average Price Analysis:
- YTD Average Price
- MTD Average Price
- YOY Growth in Average Price
- Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price

(3) Cars Sold Metrics:
